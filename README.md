# NEWS DETECTOR AI: Fake News Detector 

NEWS DETECTOR AI is a high-performance Natural Language Processing (NLP) system designed to classify news articles as **Real** or **Fake**. By leveraging the power of **DistilBERT** (a distilled version of Google's BERT), the model achieves state-of-the-art results in identifying misinformation.

##  Project Overview
Misinformation spreads rapidly in the digital age. This project provides a robust solution for verifying the authenticity of news headlines and bodies. The model is trained on combined text (Title + Content) to understand the full context of a news story.

### Key Features:
- **BERT Integration:** Uses `TFDistilBertForSequenceClassification` for deep contextual understanding.
- **High Accuracy:** Reached **96% accuracy** on the test dataset.
- **Modern Web UI:** A clean, Glassmorphism-inspired frontend built with Flask, HTML, and CSS.
- **Real-time Stamps:** Visual "REAL" or "FAKE" rubber-stamp verification effect.

##  Dataset
The model was trained on the [Fake or Real News Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jillanisofttech/fake-or-real-news) from Kaggle.
- **Total Samples:** ~6,300 news articles.
- **Classes:** Balanced (Fake / Real).
- **Preprocessing:** Tokenization via `DistilBertTokenizerFast`.

##  Tech Stack
- **Deep Learning:** TensorFlow, Transformers (Hugging Face)
- **Data Science:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- **Backend:** Flask, Flask-CORS
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3 (Modern UI), JavaScript
